Doing some Data Stuctures and Algorithms from "Grokking Algorithms" and "Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy Data Structures and Algorithmic Puzzles" books.
These are written in python but an implementation on rust will be done too to better understand low-level programming (pointers,ownership etc).

It's an introduction to latter read "Introduction to Algorithms" from : Thomas H. Cormen and beeing able to be more efficient at leetcode.
